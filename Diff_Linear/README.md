# crypto

The code was implemented base
on [A Tutorial on Linear and Differential Cryptanalysis](https://ioactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ldc_tutorial.pdf)
.

Run command: ```python test.py```

File Introduction:

- ```test.py```:  test module
- ```util.py```:  the file contains some tools that are used by both algorithms.
- ```differ_anlysis```: the code for differential cryptanalysis
- ```linear_anlysis```: the code for linear cryptanalysis
- ```simple_ciper```: A simple cipher module mentioned by the tutorial.
